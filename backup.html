        <h2>How TestersHub Works</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 1: Share Your App Details</strong>
            <p>
              Provide us with an overview of your app or game, including its
              functionality, target audience, and unique features. This helps us
              understand your requirements and set up the testing process
              accordingly.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 2: Grant Tester-Level Console Access</strong>
            <p>
              We require temporary tester-level access to your Google Play
              Console to handle the setup and management of the closed testing
              track. You can revoke this access once the testing is complete.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 3: Closed Testing Setup</strong>
            <p>
              We create and manage a closed testing track in your Play Console,
              add our group of 12 diverse testers, and ensure everything
              complies with Google’s requirements. This includes submitting the
              app for Google’s review and approval before testing begins.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 4: 14-Day Testing Period</strong>
            <p>
              Our team of 12 testers installs your app and uses it continuously
              for 14 days. We provide detailed feedback twice during the testing
              period (e.g., Day 4 and Day 8), helping you address issues and
              optimize functionality before the testing concludes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 5: Final Review & Production Application</strong>
            <p>
              On Day 14, we guide you through completing Google’s questionnaire
              and applying for production access. With our support, your app is
              well-prepared to pass Google's review and go live on the Play
              Store.
