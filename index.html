        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Initial Consultation:</strong> Discuss your app or game’s
            requirements and objectives.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tester Recruitment:</strong> We provide 20 engaged testers
            from diverse backgrounds, devices, and locations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>14-Day Closed Testing:</strong> Testers actively use your
            app for the required period, ensuring compliance with Google’s
            rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Regular Updates:</strong> We track tester participation,
            feedback, and performance, keeping you in the loop.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Post-Testing Guidance:</strong> Once the 14 days are
            complete, we guide you through the final steps of submitting to
            Google Play for a first-try approval.

        <h2>What Sets This Service Apart</h2>
        <p>
          I’ve spent weeks creating a personal, hands-on approach that not only
          meets Google’s strict 14-day closed testing requirement, but also
          makes the entire path from beta to approval feel smoother and more
          human.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of just handing you a list of testers, I’m there to ensure
          every participant is actually engaged, comes from a diverse range of
          backgrounds, and provides meaningful feedback. Over the course of
          helping more than 50 developers achieve a first-try pass, I’ve learned
          that transparent communication, reliable tracking, and genuine support
          make all the difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my service, you’re not just getting testers—you’re gaining a
          partner who’s invested in your success. The end result? A stress-free,
          well-guided journey to production that leaves you confident your app
          is truly ready for the spotlight.
