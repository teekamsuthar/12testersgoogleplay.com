      <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
      <p>Last updated: 16 Dec 2024</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          At TestersHub, we are committed to providing high-quality app and game
          testing services to help you meet Google Play’s compliance
          requirements. However, we understand that circumstances may arise
          where a refund may be requested. This policy outlines the terms and
          conditions under which refunds will be issued.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Eligibility for Refunds</h2>
        <p>Refunds may be issued under the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the service was not initiated within 7 days of payment due to a
            fault on our end.
          </li>
          <li>If you cancel the service before the testing process begins.</li>
          <li>
            If the service provided does not meet the agreed-upon terms or
            deliverables, as outlined in our initial communication.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Refund requests made after the testing period has started will
          generally not be eligible for a refund, as the service will already
          have been rendered. Exceptions may apply at our discretion in cases of
          extraordinary circumstances.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Non-Refundable Conditions</h2>
        <p>Refunds will not be issued under the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the testing service has already been completed as agreed.</li>
          <li>
            If the app fails Google Play’s compliance requirements due to issues
            beyond our testing scope, such as content policy violations or
            technical errors unrelated to our services.
          </li>
          <li>
            If insufficient information or access was provided to initiate the
            testing process.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the delay in service is caused by your failure to respond or
            provide required inputs.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
